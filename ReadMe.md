# Developer Role Classification from Commit Messages:

This project is my solution for the "Commit Messages: Developer Role Classification" task. The goal was to build a reproducible machine learning model that predicts a developer's role (frontend, backend, fullstack, or qa) based on the data from a single git commit.

My final model, an `xGBoostClassifier` using custom `word2Vec` embeddings, achieved a **Macro F1 Score of 0.9813** on the test set.

### Repository Structure:

Here's a guide to the important files in this project:

* `final_dataset.csv`: The raw, original data used for the project.
* `01_PreProcessing.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that cleans the raw data, engineers new features, and saves the result.
* `processed_dataset.csv`: The cleaned data file generated by the preprocessing notebook. This is the input for the next steps.
* `02_EDA.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook containing my exploratory data analysis, where I looked for patterns and insights in the cleaned data.
* `03_Modeling.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook where I built, trained, and evaluated both the baseline and the final improved model.
* `04_evaluation_report.md`: My final report summarizing the model's performance, its failure modes, and what I learned.
* `05_reflection_and_annotations.md`: A short reflection on my key design choices and ten annotated commit examples.
* `README.md`: This file, explaining how to get everything running.

    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  #On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`.
    ```
